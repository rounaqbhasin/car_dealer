This project was created when I was learning Python in class XII. Although I have improved myself ALOT after this project. :P

The purpose of this project was to show the customer via a software what stock of vehicles were available, and what modifications they can make. 
On the dealer side, it displayed the info. important to a dealer, like the stock of a vehicle, etc.

This project was made applying the concepts of both MySQL connectivity and Python.

Rest I guess is pretty understandable by the code.
Thanks for reading! :*
